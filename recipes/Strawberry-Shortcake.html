        <h4>By the time spring rolls around, nothing hits the spot quite like a strawberry shortcake. Built with a
            tender, buttery
            biscuit, it's not overly sweet and highlights juicy, fresh berries in their purest form: uncooked and
            nestled into
            floofy whipped cream.</h4>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Shortcake:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup cold buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced strawberries</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Strawberry Topping:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups ripe strawberries, hulled and quartered</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, zested</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Whipped Cream:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet; line the
                bottom with a
                round of parchment paper.</li>

            <li>flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt for shortcake together in a large mixing bowl. Whisk buttermilk,
                egg yolk,and vanilla together in a glass measuring cup until evenly combined; set aside.</li>

            <li>Scatter the butter pieces over the flour mixture. Use a rubbing motion with your fingertips and cut the
                butter into thenflour mixture to distribute. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the
                buttermilk
                mixture into the center of the well. Use a rubber spatula to mix the flour into the buttermilk mixture
                to form a moist,
                shaggy dough.</li>

            <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared skillet. Smooth the dough to distribute evenly in the pan. Press the
                sliced strawberries gently into the surface.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and baked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>To prepare the topping, stir together the quartered strawberries, sugar, and lemon zest in a medium
                mixing bowl to macerate.</li>

            <li>To prepare the whipped cream, combine whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla in a chilled mixing bowl. Using
                an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat at medium speed until soft peaks form.</li>

            <li>Spoon the strawberries and juices over the shortcake. Serve with whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
