        <h4></h4>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds steelhead trout fillets</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons dried rosemary, crushed</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Tender Quick®)</li>
            <li>1 quart water</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound alder wood chips, soaked in water or wine</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the fish fillets and place them in a shallow glass baking dish. Drizzle olive oil over the fish and season with
            garlic and rosemary. Rub the seasonings into the fish. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the curing salt in the water and pour into the dish with the fish. Let it marinate for 15 minutes per half inch
            of thickness.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare your smoker for a four hour slow burn using charcoal. The temperature should be at 150 degrees F (65
            degrees C) before you get started.</li>
            <li>Remove the fish from the brine and discard leftover liquid. Place each piece of fish onto a small piece of aluminum foil
            - just big enough to hold the fillet, and season with pepper to taste. Place them on the rack in the smoker. Sprinkle a
            handful of the soaked wood chips over the coals or place in a heat box. Cover and allow fish to smoke for 2 hours,
            adding more wood chips as needed.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat in the smoker (add more charcoal) to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and let the fish smoke until the
            internal temperature of the fillets reaches 165 degrees F (72 degrees C). Remove from the smoker and let rest for 20
            minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
