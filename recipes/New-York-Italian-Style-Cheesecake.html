        <h4>This recipe was given to me by my Italian mother-in-law. It is the type of crustless cheesecake that is sold
            in Italian
            bakeries in New York. I usually make it with whole-milk ricotta which is creamier than low fat. This is not
            a diet item!
            You can add fresh fruit topping if you desire.</h4>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 pound ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted and cooled</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>2½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the middle of the oven.</li>

            <li>Beat the cream cheese, ricotta cheese, and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until
                well combined. Beat
                in the eggs, one at a time. Add the butter, flour, cornstarch, and vanilla extract; mix until well
                combined. Fold in the
                sour cream and lemon juice. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 10-inch springform pan.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 2 more
                hours. Remove
                from oven and let cool completely. Run a thin spatula around the edge of the cheesecake before springing
                open the pan to
                remove. Serve at room temperature or cold; refrigerate leftovers.</li>

        </ol>
